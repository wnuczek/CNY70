# CNY70 Power Meter
## Using CNY70 sensor connected to ESP8266 board to read electricity usage from a simple analog electromechanical electricity meter and send the data to domoticz server.

This project emerged from my [engineering thesis](https://pawelwnuk.pl/files/Pawel%20Wnuk%20-%20Praca%20inzynierska.pdf) in which I measured efficiency of ground source heat pump. 
It required measuring electricity usage from a classic analog electromechanical electricity meter. Back then I used USB webcam and adapted image processing software running on Raspberry Pi. 
As I became more interested in home automation I looked at a more reliable solution to track electricity usage. This is what I came up with.

1. ESP8266
2. CNY70 and 2 LEDs
3. Cardboard, hot glue and black tape
